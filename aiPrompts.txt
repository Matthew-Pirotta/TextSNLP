- in my calc_sen_probability i am returning a low probability for unseen n-grams. But doesnt this blur the line between my vanilla and laplace Models? do u think it would be better to return float('-inf') instead?

- Would it make sense to assign the value of highest n-gram to interpolation for the NGramType IntEnum. for example in generate_next_word, it would make more sense for window_previous_words, if interpolation has the max n gram value rather than -1.

what do you think. If i should make this change. Would the change break my logic elsewhere?

follow up prompt:
myNgram = 2

If i where to do

if NGramType.Interpolation == myNgream:
print("Getting confused sine Trigrak ajd Interpolation have the same value)
