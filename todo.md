ASK MS:
- sen_prob should be log or normal? - LEAVE AS LOGS
- korpus 4.2 or 3? ANY CORPUS
- the 15 marks testing, is for the questions listed? not like tests for making sure the program works
- Can leave INF for vanilla, but low prob is also acceptable

DOCS:
say i used v4 for the corpus

    Possible optimisations:
    - After reading the train test split, immediately, just convert the sentences into their respective ngram
    - Store the whole training set as a counter
    - Store the test set as a set data type? but then i loose how frequent sentences are? also store as a counter ig. I DID NOT COOK WITH THE SET IDEA
    - Technically no need to retrain between vanilla and laplace, but eh

    - When funning full coprus, blue screen, specify 16GB ram

    - replace numbers with <num>
